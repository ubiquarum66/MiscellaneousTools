# MiscellaneousTools

Place to collect small but useful perl/python/c/c++ tools

## My Personal Smorgasbord of Useful Tools

## Installations

These tools are not sorted by topic or programming language ...
Thus, measures to use them or get them running are placed with  
documents associated with the tools in subdirectories.

Tools cover C , C++ , perl and - new - python things also.

## Motivation

Usage of github is part of a course I make, and central deposition of easy work tools 
comes always handy, and if they are not somehow proprietary, why not combine
course and ease of use?

## File Descriptions

...will come here and in the subdirectories as soon as the repository will start to fill.

## How to's 

see entry at 'Installation'

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.

...will come here and in the subdirectories as soon as the repository will start to fill.
